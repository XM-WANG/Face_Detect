# Face Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analysis humans' faces from the real-time video stream.
1. Circle the faces appeared in the screen.
2. For each face, predict his/ her age and gender.

## Model
The weights of the well-trained age and gender detect models are listed below:

|  Model   | Weights| Paper |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| Age Detect Model  | [model structure](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/age.prototxt), [model weights](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/dex_chalearn_iccv2015.caffemodel)| [DEX: Deep EXpectation of apparent age from a single image](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)|
| Gender Detect Model  | [model structure](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/gender.prototxt), [model weights](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/gender.caffemodel) | [DEX: Deep EXpectation of apparent age from a single image](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)|

## Requirements

### 1. Dependencies

The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. For quick deployment:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Notes: Python 3.6 is recommended.

### 2. Models

The weights of the well-trained age and gender detect models can be accessed via the link provided in the last section. Please downloads all of the four files and put them in the `model/` folder. For quick deployment:
```
cd ~/your project directory
bash download.sh
```

### 3. Folder Structure
Finally, the folder structure should looks like:
```
|-- root
    |-- face_detect.py
    |-- README.md
    |-- requirements.txt
    |-- model
    |   |-- age.prototxt
    |   |-- dex_chalearn_iccv2015.caffemodel
    |   |-- gender.prototxt
    |   |-- gender.caffemodel
    |-- download.sh
```

## Quick Start

**NOTES** :
1. Your laptop or computer should have a camera.
2. Please give this program authority to use the camera.

```
python face_detect.py
```
